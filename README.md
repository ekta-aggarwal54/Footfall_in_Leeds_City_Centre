Leeds City Council (LCC) have placed eight cameras in locations around the city centre, with the goal of monitoring the number of pedestrians in different areas of the city over time. The raw data from these cameras has been processed to give an estimate of the number of individuals in view of the camera over each period of one hour, day and night. LCC retains records of this data dating back to 2008.

This data set is of interest to several commercial and governmental organisations. The companies with outlets along the main streets would like to be able to predict future footfall as this may give them an indication of future sales. The council is interested in knowing what factors increase or decrease the number of people on the street, as this determines whether there is any potential for crowd trouble, when police may be needed to keep order or simply how many council employees are needed to remove litter. In this case study, your task is to analyse the recorded foot traffic from these cameras. A data file contains recorded numbers of pedestrians moving past each camera each hour, for all eight locations, between 2008 and 2014.

Your goal is to identify ways to predict future data and to understand the factors that cause variation in the number of pedestrians. This is an open ended project, but to get you started here are a number of ideas you might investigate:
*	Predictions of the future at different time horizons (e.g. 1 hour in advance, 1 day, or 1 year)
*	Correlations between data from different cameras
*	Connecting this data set to others (e.g. weather) You should identify appropriate statistical models to analyse the data. Furthermore, you should present clear visualisations to aid understanding of both the data set and your findings.
